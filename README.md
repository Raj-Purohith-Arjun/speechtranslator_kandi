The Speech Translator is a versatile multilingual tool built using Python that allows users to effortlessly convert spoken words into written text and translate them into multiple languages. This open-source project leverages the power of Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) and the Google Translate API to offer an intuitive and efficient speech-to-text translation experience.

Features:

Speech Recognition: The Speech Translator utilizes the speech_recognition library to capture user voice input through the microphone. It employs Google's Speech-to-Text API to accurately convert spoken words into text.

Language Support: With an extensive list of supported languages, users can input speech in any of the available languages, and the tool will automatically detect and process it accordingly.

Text Translation: The project utilizes the googletrans library, a wrapper around Google Translate, to facilitate language translation. Users can specify their preferred destination language, and the tool will translate the recognized text into the desired language using the Google Translate API.

Speech Synthesis: Once the translated text is generated, the gTTS library is utilized to convert it back into speech. The resulting audio output is saved as an MP3 file and can be played using the playsound library.

Usage:

Install Dependencies: Before running the application, make sure to install the required Python libraries using 'pip install -r requirements.txt'.

Execute the Code: Run the Python script, and the program will prompt the user to speak a phrase. The tool will then capture the voice input, recognize the speech, translate it to the selected language, and produce an audio output of the translation.

Supported Languages: The project supports numerous languages, and users can specify the desired language for both input and translation purposes.
